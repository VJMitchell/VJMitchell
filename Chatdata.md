**Chatdata**

The stakehoder is a fictional social media company. They wanted to assess the level of engagement of users on their site. I received three files
from the stakeholder - 'user', 'comments' and 'posts'.

I drew up an entity relationship diagram which explained how the tables related to each other. 

I then created the database in SQL and ran queries to report key stastistics on user engagement.
