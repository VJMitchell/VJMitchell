### *Dental Pharma Dashboard Project* 

The stakeholder was a fictional Pharmaceutical company who operated globally. They generated large amounts of data but didnt believe they were properly utilising it.
I created charts and dashboards to capture their key output and advised on the appropriate row level security the company would need to implement.
The row level security was necessary to ensure that different levels of employee could access appropriate information and safeguard key information.

The series of dashboards and charts can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/VMDentalPharmaDashboards/ProjectDuration?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Key skills**
+ Understanding Stakeholder Requirements
+ Designing charts and dashboards
+ Permissions and row level security
