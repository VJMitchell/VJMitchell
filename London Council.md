**London Council**

The stakeholder was a fictional Local Authority. They wanted to create three projects related to data they had collected on trees

Projects
+ Open data source for the public with information about all the trees in the area
+ A guide showing the environmental statistics of all the trees
+ A map and guided walk of interesting trees

I assessed the data given by the stakeholder and created a data source documentn outlining the structure of the different files. 

I used Pandas and Python to assess the different data sources. This involved assessing the shape, noting the amounts of duplicates, and creating box plots to assess the number of outliers. From this information I created a report which explained the data quality issues and how they would affect their intended goals.

**Key Skills**
